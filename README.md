# Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains all the code and datasets for the Hotel Booking Data Analysis project. This project aims to uncover insights from hotel booking data that can help improve hotel operations, customer satisfaction, and optimize booking strategies.
## What We Do
Load the Data: We start by loading booking data from a file that has details about each booking, like the type of hotel, when it was booked, if it was canceled, and more.

Clean the Data: Sometimes data has missing or wrong information. We clean this up to make sure our analysis is accurate. For example, if some bookings are missing the number of children, we fix this by filling in that missing information.

## Explore the Data

We look at the data closely to see trends and patterns. For example, we check which month has the most bookings or cancellations.

## DataVisualizations Explained
### Monthly Bookings Bar Chart


1. Line graph tracks how many bookings were canceled each month over a period.
Purpose: Understanding when cancellations peak can help hotels plan better offers or policies to reduce cancellations during those times.

3. The pie chart breaks down the percentages of different types of rooms booked (like standard, suite, deluxe).
Purpose: It shows which types of rooms are most popular among guests, helping hotels decide which rooms to promote more or upgrade.

3. The chart plots the average price paid per room per day.
Purpose: It helps to track how room prices fluctuate over time, which could be due to changes in demand, season, or promotional activities.
Guest Geographic Distribution Map

4. The map highlights where guests are coming from.
Purpose: Understanding where most of the guests originate can help hotels tailor their marketing strategies to specific regions or countries.
Correlation Matrix of Booking Features

5. The grid shows how closely related different booking features are to one another, like lead time and cancellations.
Purpose: It helps in identifying which factors influence booking behaviors, such as longer lead times leading to more cancellations.

Each of these visualizations is designed to make complex data simple to understand. By transforming numbers and categories into visual forms like charts, graphs, and maps, it becomes much easier for anyone to see patterns, trends, and outliers. This approach is not only more accessible but also enables quicker decision-making for hotel managers and staff.


## Data
The dataset used in this project is hotel_bookings.csv, which includes information about hotel bookings. Details of the dataset include columns like hotel, is_canceled, lead_time, arrival_date_year, etc.
